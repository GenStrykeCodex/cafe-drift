# ☕ Café Drift

**Café Drift** is a cozy, text-based café simulation game built in Python.  
You run a small café, prepare orders, manage ingredients, earn money, and gradually unlock new stages as your café grows.

The game starts as a CLI experience and is designed to evolve over time, with future plans for a graphical interface using Tkinter or Pygame.
