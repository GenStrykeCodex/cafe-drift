# ☕ Inventory & Ingredients

Your inventory holds all the ingredients needed to prepare orders in Café Drift.  
Managing it well is one of the most important skills in the game.

## 📦 What is the Inventory?

The inventory is a list of:
- Ingredients you own
- The quantity of each ingredient

Every order consumes ingredients from your inventory.

---

## 🧾 Using Ingredients

- Each order requires specific ingredients
- When an order is prepared, required ingredients are **consumed**
- Ingredients are deducted whether the order is perfectly or imperfectly prepared

If you don’t have enough ingredients, the order will fail.

---

## 🛒 Restocking Ingredients

You can buy ingredients using money.

When restocking:
- Each ingredient has a fixed base cost
- You can buy multiple units at once
- The total cost is shown before purchase
- You cannot buy more than your available money
- You cannot buy more than storage capacity

Restocking wisely prevents failed orders and money loss.

---

## 💰 Cost Awareness

Ingredient costs matter because:
- Order prices are calculated from ingredient costs
- Expensive ingredients lead to higher rewards
- Poor restocking decisions can drain money quickly

Always keep a balance between:
- Stocking essentials
- Saving money for safety

## 🚫 Running Out of Ingredients

If you accept an order without enough ingredients:
- The order fails immediately
- You lose money
- The customer leaves unhappy

This is the only way orders can truly fail.

## 📦 Storage Capacity

There is a limit to no. of items that a player can keep in Inventory.
- This is done to prevent hoarding of ingredients at early stage
- Inventory can be upgraded when stage increases
- Manual Storage upgrade will be added in future

## Cozy Inventory Tips

- Keep basic ingredients stocked at all times
- Reject orders if you’re unsure about stock
- Restock before accepting multiple orders
- Slow and steady stock management is better than rushing
