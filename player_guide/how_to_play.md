## The Core Gameplay Loop

Each day in Café Drift follows a simple loop:

1. A customer places an order  
2. You choose to **accept** or **reject** it  
3. If accepted, the order is prepared  
4. Money is earned (or lost)  
5. Your café progresses over time  

There are no time limits — play at your own pace.

## Orders

- Orders appear randomly based on your **current stage**
- Each order requires specific ingredients
- Some orders only unlock at higher stages

When an order appears, you can:
- **Accept** → attempt to prepare it  
- **Reject** → no reward, no penalty  

Rejecting an order is sometimes the smart choice if you lack ingredients.

## Ingredients & Inventory

- Ingredients are required to complete orders
- Each ingredient has a cost
- Ingredients must be restocked using money
- Inventory can become full, focus on progressing and clearing space

If you accept an order **without enough ingredients**, the order will fail, and you’ll lose some money.

Always check your inventory before accepting orders.

Stage progression is automatic — just keep serving customers!
