# Café Drift — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Q1. Is Café Drift a finished game?

No. Café Drift is currently in ALPHA.
This means features are still being added, balanced, and refined.
Progress may reset in future versions.

---

## Q2. Is this game hard?

No. Café Drift is designed to be cozy and forgiving.
Mistakes won’t end your game, and imperfect orders are part of learning.

---

## Q3. Can I lose the game?

There is no traditional "game over".
Poor decisions may slow your progress, but you can always recover, restock, or reset and start again.

---

## Q4. Why did my order fail?

Orders only fail if you ACCEPT them without enough ingredients.
Preparation quality does NOT cause failures — it only affects earnings.

---

## Q5. Why was the customer not fully satisfied?

This happens when preparation is imperfect.
You still earn money (slightly reduced), and the order counts as completed.
It’s a hint to improve your skills over time.

---

## Q6. Should I accept every order?

No.
Rejecting orders has no penalty and is often the smart choice if you’re low
on ingredients.

---

## Q7. How do I unlock new ingredients and orders?

By progressing through stages.
Stages increase automatically as you complete orders.

---

## Q8. Can I change my name later?

Currently, the player name is set at the start of a new game.

## Q9. What happens if I edit save files manually?

Café Drift uses integrity checks.
If save files are modified incorrectly, the game may refuse to load them.

## Q10. What is the difference between "New Game" and "Reset"?

New Game:

Reset:
- Clears progress and restores defaults

---

## Q11. Why did I earn less money for an order?

Imperfect preparation results in a 10% reduced reward.

Your storage capacity is full. Level up to increase capacity or free up storage by preparing orders.
