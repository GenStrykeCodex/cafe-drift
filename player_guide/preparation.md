# ☕ Preparation & Order Quality

Preparing drinks is the heart of Café Drift.  
This guide explains **how preparation works**, what affects success, and why not every order turns out perfect.

---

## What is Preparation?

When you accept an order:
- The game checks if you have the required ingredients
- A preparation attempt is made
- The outcome affects money earned

Preparation is influenced by **player skills and progression**, not pure luck.

---

## 🎯 Success Rate Explained

Each order has a **success rate**, shown when preparation begins.

This rate represents:
- Your barista’s current skill level
- Your stage progression
- Order difficulty

A higher success rate means better chances of preparing the order perfectly.

---

## Perfect Orders

If preparation succeeds:
- The order is completed perfectly
- You earn **full money**
- The customer is happy ☕✨

Perfect orders are the ideal outcome but not always guaranteed.

---

## Imperfect Orders (Not a Failure!)

If preparation is *not perfect*:
- The order is still completed
- You earn **10% less money**
- The customer isn’t fully satisfied

You’ll see a hint like:
> “The customer doesn’t seem fully satisfied…”

This is **not a punishment** — it’s feedback.

Imperfect orders:
- Still count as completed
- Still help stage progression
- Encourage skill improvement

---

## Failed Orders

An order only truly **fails** if:
- You accept it without enough ingredients

In this case:
- The order fails immediately
- You lose some money
- The customer leaves unhappy

Preparation rolls do **not** cause failures — missing ingredients do.
> You can always **reject** orders when low on ingredients, it won't cause penalty.

## 💡 Improving Preparation Quality

To get better results:
- Progress through stages
- Complete more orders
- Unlock better ingredients
- (Future versions may add explicit skill upgrades)

Café Drift rewards **experience over perfection**.
