# ☕ Orders Guide

Orders represent customer requests in Café Drift.  
Each order challenges your inventory management, preparation skill, and decision-making.

This guide explains how orders work and how they evolve with your café.

---

## What Is an Order?

An order includes:
- A drink name
- A list of required ingredients
- A minimum stage requirement

Orders appear randomly but are always appropriate for your current stage.

---

## How Orders Are Generated

- Orders are selected from a fixed pool
- Only orders unlocked at your stage can appear
- Higher stages unlock more complex drinks

You’ll never receive an order you can’t unlock — but you may lack ingredients.

---

## Accepting vs Rejecting Orders

When an order appears, you can:

### ✔ Accept
- Ingredients are checked
- Preparation begins
- You may earn money (or lose some)

### ✖ Reject
- No penalty
- No reward
- Sometimes the smarter choice

Rejecting is always safe.

---

## When Orders Fail

Orders fail only if:
- You accept them without enough ingredients

Preparation quality does **not** cause failure.

---

## ☕ Cozy Order Tips

- Check inventory before accepting
- Reject orders without guilt
- Complex orders bring higher rewards
- There’s no penalty for taking your time
