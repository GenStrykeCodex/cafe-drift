# ☕ Player Stats & Progression

Your **player stats** represent how your café is performing and how far you’ve progressed in Café Drift.

This guide explains what each stat means and how it affects gameplay.

---

## 🧑‍🍳 Player Name

- This is the name of your barista
- You choose it when starting a new game
- If you skip it, the default name **“Barista”** is used

Your name has no gameplay effect — it’s just for personalization.

---

## ⭐ Stage (Café Level)

Stage represents the **overall level of your café**.

As your stage increases:
- New ingredients unlock
- New orders become available
- Stage Bonus on money earned increases

Stages unlock automatically by completing orders — no manual leveling required.

---

## ⭐ Skill Level

Skill level represents the **experience of the player**.

As your skill increases:
- Preparation success improves
- Skill Bonus increases (future rewards)

Skill level is increased parallel to Stage but in future versions it will change.

---

## 💰 Money

Money is used to:
- Buy ingredients
- Keep your café running
- Progress safely through stages

You earn money by:
- Completing orders
- Preparing drinks well

You lose money by:
- Accepting orders without enough ingredients
- Making costly mistakes

Managing money wisely is key to long-term progress.

---

## 📋 Orders Completed

This stat tracks:
- All successfully served orders
- Both perfect and imperfect preparations

Even if the customer is not fully satisfied, the order still counts as completed.

---

## ❌ Orders Failed

Orders only fail when:
- You accept an order without enough ingredients

Failed orders:
- Reduce your money
- Slow down progression

Preparation quality does **not** cause failures.

---

## 🚫 Orders Rejected

Rejected orders are:
- Orders you choose not to accept
- Safe decisions with no penalty

Rejecting an order is sometimes the best choice if you’re unprepared.

---

## 📈 How Stats Work Together

Your stats are interconnected:
- Completing orders increases stage
- Higher stages unlock better content
- Better preparation improves earnings
- More earnings allow better inventory management

Café Drift is about **steady growth**, not rushing.

---

## 💾 Saving & Persistence

All player stats:
- Are saved automatically
- Persist between sessions
- Are protected from tampering

You can safely exit and continue your journey later.

---

## ☕ Final Tip

Don’t worry about perfect stats.
Focus on learning the systems, serving customers, and enjoying the cozy flow of your café.

Your café grows with you 🌱
