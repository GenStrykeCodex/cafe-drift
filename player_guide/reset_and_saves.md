# ☕ Reset, Saves & Progress Safety

Café Drift automatically saves your progress so you can relax and enjoy the game without worry.

This guide explains how saving and resetting works.

---

## 💾 Automatic Saving

Your game progress is saved:
- After important actions
- When orders are handled
- When inventory or money changes

You don’t need to manually save — the game does it for you.

---

## 🔒 Save Integrity Protection

Café Drift protects save files to:
- Prevent corruption
- Detect tampering
- Ensure fair progression

If a save file is altered incorrectly, the game may refuse to load it.

This system exists to keep gameplay stable.

---

## 🔁 Start New Game

Starting a new game:
- Creates a fresh café
- Lets you choose your barista name
- Uses default starting stats and inventory

Use this if you want a clean start without deleting files manually.

---

## ♻️ Reset Game

Resetting the game:
- Clears all progress
- Restores default stats and inventory
- Keeps the game structure intact

Reset is useful for:
- Testing
- Learning the game again
- Recovering from mistakes

---

## 🚪 Exit & Continue

- Exiting the game does not lose progress
- You can safely continue later from where you left off

Your café is always waiting for you.

---

## ⚠️ Alpha Version Notice

Because Café Drift is in alpha:
- Save formats may change in future versions
- Older saves may not always be compatible

When major updates arrive, starting a new game may be recommended.

## ☕ Final Thought

Resetting isn’t failure — it’s part of learning.  
Your café journey is yours to shape, one cup at a time 🌱
